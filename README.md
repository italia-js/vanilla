# Vanilla

Vanilla is a bot created with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) for [Italia JS](https://italia-js.org) by members of its community.

It's an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) project, everybody is welcome to suggest new features or improve existing ones.

If you're interested in being involved on a more regular basis, contact `@granze` on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/RWVhXuJUVN) to join the dev team. You'll be granted a role, a special color, and access to the private channel `#vanilla-dev`, not to mention eternal gratitude from the community.

Developing commands for Vanilla is a lot of fun, and it can be a good starting point to approach open source.

Looking forward to see your contribution! ðŸ’ª
